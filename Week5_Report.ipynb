    "It might be apparant to say that Chinatown should be selected as the new Chinese Restaurant location, and it is indeed a pace where many popular Chinese Restaurants are located. However, city area costs more investments, and from the chinese_restaurants.csv we can see that a Chinese Restaurant in Chinatown tends to have more compitations not only from Chinese restaurants, but also from food courts and other Asian Restaurants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore I would apply *the Blue Ocean Strategy* and select **Jurong East** as the location to build a neighborhood Chinese Restaurant. **Jurong East** MRT interchange is a residential area with many shopping venues, Chinese Restaurants are popular there, and it is far from the compitations"

    "In this project, MRT stations in Singapre are gathered from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Singapore_MRT_stations) using **pandas.read_html**, all interchange stations are extracted and their coordinates are found. With those information, **Foursquare** API is called to explore 200ms around all the MRT interchange stations in Singapore, and their top 10 most common venues are found. Then new data frame is being created by filtering the MRT station where Chinese Restaurant is the top common venue. Finally clustering was applied on the MRT data all data is visualised on a map plotted by **folium**. With all the data analysed and visualised, a conclusion was drawn that the new Chinese Restaurant is to be located around **Jurong East** station."
